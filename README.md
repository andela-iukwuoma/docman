## A Full-Stack Document Management System

Docman Pro is an application that helps users manage their documents in an organized way. A User can create, read, update and delete a document. Public documents are visible to every user while private documents can be seen only by the owner and the admins. Role documents can be seen by everyone on the same role with the owner as well as the admins.
The application uses RESTful API for managing documents, users, roles and searches.

## Features

The app has three major levels of authorization;
-  An author can
    - create an account
    - login/logout
    - edit and delete his profile
    - edit and delete documents created    
    - limit access to a document by specifying an access level of public, private or role.
    - view public documents created by other users.
    - view `role` documents created by users with the same role level.
    - search for documents
    

- An admin has all the privileges of an author and can also:
    - view details of all users and their documents.
    - search for users.

- A superadmin has all the privileges of an admin and can also:
    - update a user's role e.g upgrade another user to admin.
    - create roles.
    - edit existing roles
    - Delete created roles apart from admins and author roles.

## FAQ

- **What if I want to use another port?**

That's easy. In the root of the project. create a file named `.env` and add the following line to it:

```bash
PORT=<your_desired_port>
```

where <your\_desired\_port> is the port you want to use. So, if you want to use port `9000`, you will write:

```bash
PORT=9000
```
